Pasta with ’Nduja & Spring Vegetables
I let the Hudson Farmers’ Market be my guide for this pasta that combines spicy ’nduja, a spreadable salami, with peak spring vegetables and just a bit of cream. The vegetables are blanched until just cooked through so they maintain their snappy texture and sweet flavor, which cuts the richness of the sauce. 

SERVES 4

2 tablespoons kosher salt
¾ pound gemelli or fusilli
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut on an angle into 1-inch pieces
½ pound sugar snap peas, ends trimmed and halved crosswis
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup frozen pearl onions
4 ounces ’nduja
½ cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh tarragon

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the salt and return to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the package directions for al dente instruct. Add the asparagus and snap peas and cook until crisp and tender, 1 minute more.

While the pasta cooks, prepare the sauce: Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the pearl onions and sauté until they begin to brown in spots, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Add the ’nduja to the skillet, breaking it up with the back of a spoon. Cook until it melts, about 2 minutes. Add the cream, bring to a simmer, and cook until the sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.

Return the onions to the skillet and add the pasta and vegetables directly to the skillet. Toss to coat until the pasta becomes glossy, adding ¼ cup of pasta water or more (up to 1 cup), as needed to loosen up the sauce.

Plate in bowls and top with the tarragon.

COOK’S NOTE: I like to use asparagus that’s on the leaner side for this recipe as I find that fat stalks aren’t as flavorful. However, you don’t want them pencil thin. This recipe also calls for frozen pearl onions for ease. If you feel strongly about using fresh, keep in mind it will add extra time and preparation to the recipe as you’ll need to trim their roots and boil them before peeling.
